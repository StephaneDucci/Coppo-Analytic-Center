# Coppo 1896 - Sales Dashboard and Sales & Supply Strategies

This project is a **pilot draft** of a potential dashboard for the management of **Coppo 1896 SpA**, developed to:

- **Track sales** of Coppo products (spirits & cosmetics).
- **Define new strategies** for sales and supply chain management.

## Context and Objectives

In the absence of a unified management system between the **warehouse**, **retail stores**, and **e-commerce**, this dashboard provides:
- An **effective compromise** for unified performance analysis.
- A **reference point** for inventory and stock management.

## Key Features

The dashboard enables:
- **Historical analysis** of sales trends and pricing.
- Informed decision-making on:
  - **Supply chain strategies**.
  - **Sales strategies**.
- Monitoring inventory levels to minimize the risk of overstock or stockouts.

## Notes and Limitations
